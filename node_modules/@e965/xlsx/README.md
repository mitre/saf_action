# [SheetJS](https://sheetjs.com)

> Since the authors of the original package decided to stage their
[dumb](https://github.com/SheetJS/sheetjs/issues/2667) [protest](https://git.sheetjs.com/sheetjs/sheetjs/issues/2667)
that makes most of the community unable to access their package without
[vulnerabilities](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4r6h-8v6p-xvw6),
I decided to make this project. It automatically takes a fresh version of SheetJS
from their git repository, and publishes to npm if the version is different.
The whole process is automated and works through Github Actions.

The SheetJS Community Edition offers battle-tested open-source solutions for
extracting useful data from almost any complex spreadsheet and generating new
spreadsheets that will work with legacy and modern software alike.

[SheetJS Pro](https://sheetjs.com/pro) offers solutions beyond data processing:
Edit complex templates with ease; let out your inner Picasso with styling; make
custom sheets with images/graphs/PivotTables; evaluate formula expressions and
port calculations to web apps; automate common spreadsheet tasks, and much more!
