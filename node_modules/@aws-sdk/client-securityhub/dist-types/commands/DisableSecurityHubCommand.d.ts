/**
 * <p>Disables Security Hub in your account only in the current Amazon Web Services Region. To disable Security Hub in all
 *          Regions, you must submit one request per Region where you have enabled Security Hub.</p>
 *          <p>You can't disable Security Hub in an account that is currently the Security Hub administrator.</p>
 *          <p>When you disable Security Hub, your existing findings and insights and any Security Hub configuration
 *          settings are deleted after 90 days and cannot be recovered. Any standards that were enabled
 *          are disabled, and your administrator and member account associations are removed.</p>
 *          <p>If you want to save your existing findings, you must export them before you disable
 *          Security Hub.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { SecurityHubClient, DisableSecurityHubCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-securityhub"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { SecurityHubClient, DisableSecurityHubCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-securityhub"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new SecurityHubClient(config);
 * const input = {};
 * const command = new DisableSecurityHubCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param DisableSecurityHubCommandInput - {@link DisableSecurityHubCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link DisableSecurityHubCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link DisableSecurityHubCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DisableSecurityHubCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link SecurityHubClientResolvedConfig | config} for SecurityHubClient's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link AccessDeniedException} (client fault)
 *  <p>You don't have permission to perform the action specified in the request.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InternalException} (server fault)
 *  <p>Internal server error.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InvalidAccessException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The account doesn't have permission to perform this action.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link LimitExceededException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The request was rejected because it attempted to create resources beyond the current Amazon Web Services
 *          account or throttling limits. The error code describes the limit exceeded.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link ResourceNotFoundException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The request was rejected because we can't find the specified resource.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link SecurityHubServiceException}
 * <p>Base exception class for all service exceptions from SecurityHub service.</p>
 *
 * @public
 * @example To deactivate Security Hub
 * ```javascript
 * // The following example deactivates Security Hub for the current account and Region.
 * const input = {};
 * const command = new DisableSecurityHubCommand(input);
 * await client.send(command);
 * // example id: to-deactivate-security-hub-1676583894245
