 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript

 *
 * @throws {@link InvalidInputException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The request was rejected because you supplied an invalid or out-of-range value for an
 *          input parameter.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link LimitExceededException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The request was rejected because it attempted to create resources beyond the current Amazon Web Services
