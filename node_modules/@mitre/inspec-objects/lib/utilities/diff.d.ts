 * The function performs the following:
 * - If the diff value has a `__new` property, it compares the `__new` and
 *   `__old` values after removing whitespace. If they are different, it sets
 *   the result to the `__new` value.
 * - If the diff value is an array, it maps and filters the array to include
 *   only the new values.
 * - If the diff value is an object, it recursively processes the object.
 * - If the key ends with `__deleted`, it ignores the value.
 * - Otherwise, it sets the result to the diff value.
 *
 * @param diffData - The diff object containing differences to process.
 * @returns A new object with formatting differences ignored.
