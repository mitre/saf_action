# ts-inspec-objects
Typescript objects for InSpec Profiles

This repository contains the source code that facilitates the writing of InSpec Profiles (for use in things like stub generation and delta comparisons) more consistent with `Chef Cookstyle` formatting for ease of use when comparing with new changes from delta and when generating InSpec stubs that match a standard format. 

For more information about Chef Cookstyle see: 
 - [chef/cookstyle on GitHub](https://github.com/chef/cookstyle)
 - [Chef Cookstyle on Chef documents page](https://docs.chef.io/workstation/cookstyle/)

The `ts-inspec-objects` provides the capability of updating InSpect Profiles and creating stub Profiles based on XCCDF Benchmarks. This is accomplished by providing `Profile` and `Control` classes and supporting methods (functions).

## How to Use
The process code maintained in this repository generates a `npm` executable that is published to the `npm registry` as [mitre-inspec-objects](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mitre/inspec-objects).

To use the `mitre-inspec-objects` npm package, simply add the package as a dependency to your project application using the npm install command:
```
npm install mitre-inspec-objects
```
The package is a CommonJS-based npm written in TypeScript 

## Parsing Process

When using this library to parse `InSpec Profiles` or `xccdf files` for the purposes of generating InSpec profiles, the general workflow is as follows:
```
  - The input is processed, read into a typescript object
  - Operated on with any required action / logic
  - Then written into an InSpec profile as output. 
```
This means that we can not simply write out in the same format we got in. Instead, we have to make choices about formatting for how to write out content.

Here are some formatting choices that are being made.

1. String quotation

      | The string contains | Use	|
      |--------	|--------------------	|
      | single (') and double (") quotes| percent string syntax - %q() |
      | single (') quotes | double (") quotes |
      | other | single (') quotes	|

2. Tag keywords are not quoted (ex: tag severity: 'medium')
3. Each control file ends with a newline

### XCCDF Workflow Process
Processes an XCCDF (Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format) XML string based on the `Rule Identifier` provided and converts it into a Profile object.
If and OVAL definition is provided it retrives the oval objects and associated states and the Controls description check text is update with the content.

### OVAL Workflow Process
Processes an OVAL (Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language) XML string and converts it into a JSON object.
The process extracts definitions and their associated criteria references and resolved values.
The process executes the following steps:
1. Converts the OVAL XML string into a JSON object.
2. Iterates through the OVAL definitions and extracts each definition.
3. For each definition, extracts criteria references and resolves the associated objects and states.
4. Logs warnings if any objects or states cannot be found.

### InSpec Profile Workflow Process
Process a JSON string representing an InSpec profile, converts it, and processes it to return a `Profile` object.
It handles different versions of the InSpec JSON format and sorts the controls by their ID.

### Update Profile Using XCCDF Workflow Process
Updates a Profile with new metadata from and XCCDF, based on the `Rule Indetefier` and logs the process.

### Update Control Workflow Process
Updates a given control object with the provided partial control and logs the process.
