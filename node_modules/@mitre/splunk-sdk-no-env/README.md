## Installation

This section describes the basic steps for installing the Splunk Enterprise SDK for JavaScript.


### Use the Splunk Enterprise SDK for JavaScript components on your web page

To use the components from the Splunk Enterprise SDK for JavaScript on your web page, copy the **/splunk-sdk-javascript/client** directory to your web server.
Then, include the **splunk.js** or **splunk.min.js** file from this directory in your code.

For example, include one of the following tags in your code:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="/yourpath/splunk.js"></script>

Or:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="/yourpath/splunk.min.js"></script>

You can also include the UI components, such as the Timeline and Charting controls. These UI component files (**splunk.ui.timeline** and **splunk.ui.charting**) are also in the **/splunk-sdk-javascript/client** directory.

### Install Node.js in your project

To use the Splunk Enterprise SDK for JavaScript with your Node.js programs, install the SDK by running `npm` in *your* project's directory as follows:

    npm install splunk-sdk

Then, to include the Splunk Enterprise SDK for JavaScript, use the `require` function in your code:

    var splunkjs = require('splunk-sdk');

## Usage

The following examples show you how to list search jobs using client-side and server-side code.

### Client-side code example

This HTML example uses the Splunk Enterprise SDK for JavaScript to list all jobs:
```javascript
    <script type="text/javascript" src="splunk.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.min.js"></script>

    <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8">

        var service = new splunkjs.Service({username: "admin", password: "changed!"});
        service.login(function(err, success) {
            if (err) {
                throw err;
            }

            console.log("Login was successful: " + success);
            service.jobs().fetch(function(err, jobs) {
                var jobList = jobs.list();
                for(var i = 0; i < jobList.length; i++) {
                    console.log("Job " + i + ": " + jobList[i].sid);
                }
            });
        });

    </script>
```

### Node.js code example

This example shows how to use the Splunk Enterprise SDK for JavaScript and Node.js to list all jobs:

```javascript
    var splunkjs = require('splunk-sdk');

    var service = new splunkjs.Service({username: "admin", password: "changed!"});
    service.login(function(err, success) {
        if (err) {
            throw err;
        }

        console.log("Login was successful: " + success);
        service.jobs().fetch(function(err, jobs) {
            var jobList = jobs.list();
            for(var i = 0; i < jobList.length; i++) {
                console.log("Job " + i + ": " + jobList[i].sid);
            }
        });
    });
```

## SDK examples

The Splunk Enterprise SDK for JavaScript contains several server- and client-based examples.
For details, see the [Splunk Enterprise SDK for JavaScript Examples](https://dev.splunk.com/enterprise/docs/devtools/javascript/sdk-javascript/sdkjavascriptexamples) on the Splunk Developer Portal.

#### Create a .splunkrc convenience file

To connect to Splunk Enterprise, many of the SDK examples and unit tests take command-line arguments that specify values for the host, port, and login credentials for Splunk Enterprise. For convenience during development, you can store these arguments as key-value pairs in a text file named **.splunkrc**. Then, the SDK examples and unit tests use the values from the **.splunkrc** file when you don't specify them.

>**Note**: Storing login credentials in the **.splunkrc** file is only for convenience during development. This file isn't part of the Splunk platform and shouldn't be used for storing user credentials for production. And, if you're at all concerned about the security of your credentials, enter them at the command line rather than saving them in this file.

To use this convenience file, create a text file with the following format:

    # Splunk Enterprise host (default: localhost)
    host=localhost
    # Splunk Enterprise admin port (default: 8089)
    port=8089
    # Splunk Enterprise username
    username=admin
    # Splunk Enterprise password
    password=changed!
    # Access scheme (default: https)
    scheme=https
    # Your version of Splunk Enterprise
    version=8.2

Save the file as **.splunkrc** in the current user's home directory.

*   For example on OS X, save the file as:

        ~/.splunkrc

*   On Windows, save the file as:

        C:\Users\currentusername\.splunkrc

    You might get errors in Windows when you try to name the file because ".splunkrc" appears to be a nameless file with an extension. You can use the command line to create this file by going to the **C:\Users\\&lt;currentusername&gt;** directory and entering the following command:

        Notepad.exe .splunkrc

    Click **Yes**, then continue creating the file.


### Client-side examples

The Splunk Enterprise SDK for JavaScript includes several browser-based examples, which you can run from the Examples web page.

To start a simple web server and open the Examples page in a web browser, enter:

    node sdkdo examples

### Node.js examples

The Splunk Enterprise SDK for JavaScript includes several command-line examples, which are located in the **/splunk-sdk-javascript/examples/node** directory. These examples run with Node.js and use the command-line arguments from the **.splunkrc** file, if you set this up with your login credentials.

For example, to run the **jobs.js** example, open a command prompt in the **/splunk-sdk-javascript/examples/node** directory and enter:

    node jobs.js list

If you aren't storing your login credentials in **.splunkrc**, enter the following command, providing your own values:

    node jobs.js --username yourusername --password yourpassword list

Your output should look something like this:

    ~\splunk-sdk-javascript\examples\node> node .\jobs.js list
      Job 1 sid: scheduler__nobody__search_VG9wIGZpdmUgc291cmNldHlwZXM_at_1323917700_79740ae7e22350d6

      Job 6 sid: admin__admin__search_TXkgQXdlc29tZSBTYXZlZCBTZWFyY2g_1323901055.6
    ==============

## Development

The Splunk Enterprise SDK for JavaScript infrastructure relies on Node.js to build files, run examples, run tests, and generate documentation. 

All development activities are managed by a helper script called `sdkdo`. For a list of possible commands and options, open a command prompt in the **splunk-sdk-javascript** directory and enter:

    node sdkdo --help

### Compile the browser files

To rebuild and minify the browser files, open a command prompt in the **splunk-sdk-javascript** directory and enter:

    node sdkdo compile

### Run unit tests

The Splunk Enterprise SDK for JavaScript includes several unit tests for each component. You can run individual test modules or run all tests. Some searches need to be running in your Splunk Enterprise instance before you run these tests. You can start some searches by logging into Splunk Web and opening the Search app, which runs a few searches to populate the dashboard.

>**Note**: The [SDK App Collection](https://github.com/splunk/sdk-app-collection) app is required for running unit tests.

To run the unit tests, open a command prompt in the **splunk-sdk-javascript** directory, then run the following commands. 

To run all tests, enter:

    node sdkdo tests

To run the HTTP and the Async tests, enter:

    node sdkdo tests http,async

To run tests containing a particular string, enter:

    node sdkdo tests --grep "While success"

To run the browser tests, enter:

    node sdkdo tests-browser

To run all unit tests without log messages, enter:

    node sdkdo tests --quiet

To run all the tests and generate test report in **splunk-sdk-javascript/mochawesome-report/mochawesome.html**, enter:

    node sdkdo tests --reporter mochawesome

To get more info to run tests, enter:

    make test_specific
