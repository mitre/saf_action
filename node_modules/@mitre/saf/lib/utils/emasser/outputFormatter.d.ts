 * @param data - The data object to be formatted.
 * @param doConversion - A boolean flag indicating whether to perform data conversion. Defaults to true.
 * @returns The formatted data as a JSON string.
 *
 * The function performs the following operations based on the configuration:
 * - If debugging is enabled, it logs the entire data object.
 * - If the data object contains headers, it extracts the data property.
 * - If doConversion is true, it processes the data object to remove null values and convert epoch times to human-readable dates.
 * - If hideNulls is true, it removes null values from the data object.
 * - If showEpoch is true, it converts epoch times to human-readable dates.
 *
 * The function handles different structures of the data object, including arrays and nested objects.
 * It merges the processed data into a new object and returns it as a formatted JSON string.
